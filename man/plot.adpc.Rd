}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{adpc}. (Low dimensional) ADPROCLUS solution}

\item{type}{Choice for type of plot: one of "Network", "Profiles", "LowDimComponents". Default: "Network".}

\item{title}{String. OPTIONAL.}

\item{...}{ignored}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input model.

\description{
When passing a (low dimensional) ADPROCLUS solution of class \code{adpc} to the generic \code{plot()},
this method plots the solution in one of the following three ways:
\describe{
\item{\code{Network}}{Each cluster is a vertex and
the edge between two vertices represents the overlap between the corresponding clusters.
The size of a vertex corresponds to the cluster size. The overlap is represented
through color, width and numerical label of the edge.
The numerical edge-labels can be relative (number of overlap observations / total observations)
or absolute (number of observations in both clusters).}
\item{\code{Profiles}}{Plot the profile matrix (\eqn{\boldsymbol{P}} for full dimensional model,
\eqn{\boldsymbol{C}} for low dimensional model)in the style of a correlation plot to visualize the
relation of each cluster with each variable.}
\item{code{Low Dimensional Components}}{Plot the low dimensional component-by-variable matrix \eqn{\boldsymbol{B'}}
 in the style of a correlation plot to visualize the relation of each component with each original variable.
 \strong{NOTE:} Only works for low dimensional ADPROCLUS.}
