# ADPROCLUS

This package is an implementation of the additive profile clustering (ADPROCLUS) method in R. It can be used to obtain overlapping clustering models for object-by-variable data matrices. It also contains the low dimensional ADPROCLUS method, which achieves a simultaneous dimension reduction when searching for overlapping clusters. This can be used when the object-by-variable data contains a very large number of variables.

The current version is 0.2.05. The package is under development and will be submitted to CRAN in late 2019.
